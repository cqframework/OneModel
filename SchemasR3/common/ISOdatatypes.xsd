			<xs:documentation>Defines the basic properties of every data value. This is conceptually an abstract type, meaning that no proper value can be just a data value without belonging to any concrete type. Every public concrete type is a specialization of this general abstract DataValue type. 

However exceptional values (nullFlavored values) may be of type ANY, except for the exceptional values that imply the nullFlavor INV, since this requires a type to be meaningful. Note that not all nullFlavors may be used with the type ANY (see section 7.1.4 for more details)</xs:documentation>

Though the nullFlavor concept has some relationship with the UML/OCL null, it is not the same thing, and the relationship and differences between the two must be understood to properly implement this specification. For further discussion, see section 7.1.4 (Null and NullFlavor). Note that nullFlavor includes the concept of a UML null value, and also includes potentially fully populated instances that do not conform to the requirements placed on the instance (also known as "exceptional instances"). Both nonNull and nullFlavored values SHALL always be valid according to the rules expressed in this specification.

No other processing should depend on the content of the flavor attribute. 

No other semantic or computational use SHALL depend on the value of this property. If this value is populated, the datatype flavor(s) SHALL be a valid constraint on the type of the value.

This includes unformatted or formatted written language, multimedia data, or structured information as defined by a different standard (e.g., XML-signatures.) 
Encapsulated data can be present in two forms, inline or by reference. The content is the same whether it is located inline or remote.Inline data is communicated or moved as part of the encapsulated data value, whereas by-reference data may reside at a different  location: a URL/URI that provides reference to the information required to locate the data. Inline data may be provided in one of 3 different ways:

	- as a plain sequence of characters (value)
	- as a binary (a sequence of bytes) (data)
	- as xml content (xml)

Content SHALL be provided if the ED has no nullFlavor. The content may be provided in-line (using only one of value, data or xml), or it may be provided as a reference.Content may be provided in-line and a reference also may be given; in these cases, it is expected that the content of the reference will be exactly the same as the in-line content.

The semantic value of an encapsulated data value is the same, regardless whether the content is present as inline content or just by reference.

An encapsulated data value may have both inline content and a reference.

If data is provded in the value, data or xml attributes, the reference SHALL point to the same data. It is an error if the data resolved through the reference does not match either the integrity check, data as provided, or data that had earlier been retrieved through the reference and then cached. The mediatype of the ED SHALL match the type returned by accessing the reference. 

The reference may contain a usablePeriod to indicate that the data may only be available for a limited period of time. Whether the reference is limited by a usablePeriod or not, the content of the reference SHALL be fixed for all time.

A thumbnail requires significantly fewer resources than the full content, while still maintaining some distinctive similarity with the full content. A thumbnail is typically used with by-reference encapsulated data. It allows a user to select the appropriate content more efficiently before actually downloading through the reference.

Originally, the term thumbnail refers to an image in a lower resolution (or smaller size) than another image. However, the thumbnail concept can be metaphorically used for media types other than images. For example, a movie may be represented by a shorter clip; an audio-clip may be represented by another audio-clip that is shorter, has a lower sampling rate, or a lossy compression; or an abstract provided for a long document.

A thumbnail itself SHALL NOT contain a thumbnail.</xs:documentation>

Examples are object identifier for HL7 RIM objects, medical record number, order id, service catalog item id, Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), etc. Instance identifiers are usually defined based on ISO object identifiers.

An identifier allows someone to select one record, object or thing from a set of candidates. Usually an identifier alone without any context is not usable. Identifiers are distinguished from concept descriptors as concept descriptors never identify an individual thing, although there may sometimes be an individual record or object that represents the concept.

If root is populated, and there is no nullFlavor or extension, then the root is a globally unique identifier in it's own right. In the presence of a non-null extension, the root is the unique identifier for the "namespace" of the identifier in the extension. Note that this does NOT necessarily correlate with the organization that manages the issuing of the identifiers. A given organization may manage multiple identifier namespaces, and control over a given namespace may transfer from organization to organization over time while the root remains the same. 

This field can be either a DCE UUID, an Object Identifier (OID), or a special identifier taken from lists that may be published by ISO or HL7. 

Comparison of root values is always case sensitive. UUID's SHALL be represented in upper case, so UUID case should always be preserved.

The root and extension scheme means that the concatenation of root and extension SHALL be a globally unique identifier for the item that this II value identifies.

Some identifier schemes define certain style options to their code values. For example, the U.S. Social Security Number (SSN) is normally written with dashes that group the digits into a pattern "123-12-1234". However, the dashes are not meaningful and a SSN can also be represented as "123121234" without the dashes. In the case where identifier schemes provide for multiple representations, HL7 or ISO may make a ruling about which is the preferred form and document that ruling where that respective external identifier scheme is recognized.

If no extension attribute is provided in a non-null II, then the root is the complete unique identifier. If the root is not a complete unique identifier, and the extension is not known, then the II  SHALL have a nullFlavor even if the root is populated.</xs:documentation>

IdentifierName does NOT refer to the organization which issued the identifier (e.g. California Dept. of Motor Vehicles). It is intended for use as a human readable label when an identifier must be displayed to a human user where an OID would not be meaningful. 

The Identifier Name has no computational value. IdentifierName can never modify the meaning of the root attribute. The purpose of the Identifer Name is to assist an unaided human interpreter of an II value to interpret the authority.

						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The unit of measure specified in the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM). 

UCUM defines two forms of expression, case sensitive and case insensitive. PQ uses the case sensitive codes. The codeSystem OID for the case sensitive form is 2.16.840.1.113883.6.8. The default value for unit is the UCUM code "1" (unity).

Equality of physical quantities does not require the values and units to be equal independently. Value and unit is only how we represent physical quantities. For example, 1 m equals 100 cm. Although the units are different and the values are different, the physical quantities are equal. Therefore one should never expect a particular unit for a physical quantity but instead allow for automated conversion between different comparable units. 

The unit SHALL come from UCUM, which only specifies unambiguous measurement units. Sometimes it is not clear how some measurements in healthcare map to UCUM codes.

Note: The general pattern for a measurement is  value unit  of Thing. In this scheme, the PQ represents the  value and the unit, and the Thing is described by some coded concept that is linked to the PQ by the context of use. This maps obviously to some measurements, such as Patient Body Temperature of 37 Celsius, and 250 mg/day of Salicylate.

However for some measurements that arise in healthcare, the scheme is not so obvious. Two classic examples are 5 Drinks of Beer, and 3 Acetominophen tablets. At first glance it is tempting to classify these measurments like this: 5 drinks of Beer and 3 Acetominophen tablets. The problem with this is that UCUM does not support units of "beer", "tablets" or "scoops".

The reason for this is that neither tablets or scoops are proper units. What kind of tablets? How big is the glass? In these kinds of cases, the concept that appears to be a unit needs to further specified before interoperability is established. If a correct amount is required, then it is generally appropriate to specify an exact measurement with an appropriate UCUM unit. If this is not possible, then the concept is not part of the measurement. UCUM provides a unit called unity for use in these cases. The proper way to understand these measurements as 3 1 Acetominophen tablets, where 1 is the UCUM unit for unity, and the Thing has a qualifier. The context of use will need to provide the extra qualifying information.</xs:documentation>

Notes: 
1.	Ratios are different from rational numbers, i.e., in ratios common factors in the numerator and denominator never cancel out. A ratio of two real or integer numbers is not automatically reduced to a real number. This datatype is not defined to generally represent rational numbers. It is used only if common factors in numerator and denominator are not supposed to cancel out. This is only rarely the case. For observation values, ratios occur almost exclusively with titers. In most other cases, REAL should be used instead of the RTO.
2.	Since many implementation technologies expect generics to be collections, or only have one parameter, RTO is not implemented as a generic in this specification. Constraints at the point where the RTO is used will define which form of QTY are used.</xs:documentation>

Parameter: T : ANY

A collection that contains distinct and discrete values in no particular order.

Valid (non-nullFlavored) Discrete Sets SHALL not contain duplicate  items. The context of use SHALL define how elements are compared when checking set element uniqueness. By default, the uniqueness definition is based on the equality rules defined in this specification: Discrete sets SHALL not contain different values that are equal, and they SHALL not contain items that are null or have a nullFlavor, where the equality cannot be evaluated. When a Discrete Set is actually used, the context of use may specify an alternative definition for how uniqueness is evaluated. This alternative definition may allow for nullFlavored values in a proper set. Information Processing Entities providing alternative definitions for the uniqueness of a set SHALL make it clear in the conformance statement how such definitions are provided so that there is no ambiguity.

While proper (non-nullFlavored) sets will not contain values that do not meet the definition of uniqueness, Discrete Sets with a nullFlavor may contain elements duplicate values or values that have a nullFlavor. Note that Discrete Sets that are labelled as mandatory cannot have a nullFlavor and therefore cannot contain such values</xs:documentation>

The items are held in a bag because the context of use specifies exactly how uniqueness is specified for the DSET.

Though the internal structure allows duplicates, all the items in the set SHALL be unique according the definition provided by the context of use. If the context of use does not make this clear, the default behaviour is the equality definitions provided in this standard.

These attributes exist because sometimes this information is required, but the value is being represented in an external context that does not contain a proper relationship to the control information for the value itself.

Parameter: T : QTY

An unordered set of distinct values which are quantities. 

Any ordered type can be the basis of an QSET; it does not matter whether the base type is discrete or continuous. If the base datatype is only partially ordered, all elements of the QSET must be elements of a totally ordered subset of the partially ordered datatype (for example, PQ is only ordered when the units are consistent. Every value in a QSET(PQ) must have the same canonical unit).

QSET is an abstract type. A working QSET is specified as an expression tree built using a combination of operator (QSI, QSD, QSU, QSP) and component types (QSC, QSS and IVL; and, for TS, PIVL and EIVL).

Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the set on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. 

It is valid to use a QSET derived datatype to store only the text that the user entered or uttered. In this situation, original text will exist without a valid value. The originalText is not a substitute for a valid value. If the actual content of the QSET is not valid, then the QSET SHALL be nullFlavored, irrespective of whether originalText has a value or not.

The original text SHALL be an excerpt of the relevant information in the original sources, rather than a pointer or exact reproduction. Thus the original text SHALL be represented in plain text form. In specific circumstances, when clearly descirbed the context of use, the originalText may be a reference to some other text artefact for which the resolution scope is clearly described.

Note: The details of the link in the originalText.reference between different artifacts of medical information (e.g., document and coded result) is outside the scope of this specification and may be further proscribed in specifications that use this specification.</xs:documentation>

1	unordered	unordered	The list is not ordered

The default value is unordered.

Note: Unordered lists are typically rendered with bullets, whereas ordered lists are typically rendered with numbers, although this is not a requirement.</xs:documentation>

	<xs:complexType name="CD">
		<xs:annotation>
			<xs:documentation>A CD is a reference to a concept defined in an external code system, terminology, or ontology. A CD may contain a simple code - that is, a reference to a concept defined directly by the referenced code system, or it may contain an expression in some syntax defined by the referenced code system that can be meaningfully evaluated. e.g., the concept of a "left foot" as a postcoordinated term built from the primary code "FOOT" and the qualifier "LEFT". 

A CD may also contain an original text or phrase that served as the basis of the coding. This is preserved to allow for validation of the representation of the concept in various fashions. 

A CD can contain one or more translations into multiple coding systems. The translations are all representations of the same concept in various code systems. There is only one concept, and only the first CD may contain an original text. It is possible to represent the translation chain - which CD was translated from which - if desired. Each CD may also carry a rationale to indicate why it is represented.

A CD with no nullFlavor attribute SHALL have a code attribute or nonNull originalText attribute. A CD that has a code, codeSystem or originalText attribute but does not meet external constraints of the applicable value set SHALL have a nullFlavor attribute with a value of "OTH".

Attributes with type CD are generally bound by externally specified constraints which constrain the coded concepts to which a CD may refer. These constraints may be qualified as "extensible" (CWE) or "not extensible" (CNE). If the constraint is not extensible (CNE), then a the CD that does not have a nullFlavor SHALL contain a code that conforms to the constraint. If the constraint is extensible (CWE) then a CD that does not have a nullFlavor SHALL contain either a code that exists in the domain with which the attribute is associated, a code from a locally defined code system, or just some originalText that describes the concept. If the code is taken from a locally defined code system, then the codeSystem property SHALL specify the local code system.
For both CNE and CWE constraint types, the translations may contain nonNull codes from any source unless otherwise specified by the constraining model. 

For code systems that define expression syntaxes, CNE constraints may be used, providing that the code system definitions define the appropriate support to enable value sets to make useful statements about how to control the expression syntax, and that the value set machinery used also has the appropriate support</xs:documentation>

If a code is provided, it SHALL be an exact match to a plain code symbol or expression defined by the code system. If the code system defines a code or expression that includes whitespace, the code SHALL include the whitespace. An expression can only be used where the codeSystem either defines an expression syntax, or there is a generally accepted syntax for the codeSystem. A code system may be defined that only defines an expression syntax with bindings to other code Systems for the elements of the expression. 
 It is at the discretion of the interpreting system whether to check for an expression instead of a simple code and evaluate the expression instead of treating the expression as a code. In some cases, it may be unclear or ambiguous whether the code represents a single symbol or an expression. This usually arises where the code system defines an expression language and then defines pre-coordinated concepts with symbols which match their expression, e.g. UCUM. In other cases, it is safe to treat the expression as a symbol. There is no guarantee that this is always safe: the definitions of the codeSystem should always be consulted to determine how to handle potential expressions. </xs:documentation>

Information Processing Entities claiming direct or indirect conformance SHALL NOT functionally rely on codeSystemName. In addition, they MAY choose not to implement codeSystemName but SHALL NOT reject instances because codeSystemName is present.

Note:  The purpose of a code system name is to assist an unaided human interpreter of a code value to interpret codeSystem.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="codeSystemVersion" type="String" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>If applicable, a version descriptor defined specifically for the given code system.

Different versions of one code system must be compatible. By definition a code symbol SHALL have the same meaning throughout all versions of a code system. Between versions, codes may be retired but not withdrawn or reused. Where the definition of the meaning of a code symbol changes, it must still be compatible (equal) between different code system versions.

Whenever a code system changes in an incompatible way, it will constitute a new code system, not simply a different version, regardless of how the vocabulary publisher calls it. For example, the publisher of ICD-9 and ICD-10 calls these code systems, "revision 9" and "revision 10" respectively. However, ICD-10 is a complete redesign of the ICD code, not a backward compatible version. Therefore, for the purpose of this datatype specification, ICD-9 and ICD-10 are different code systems, not just different versions. By contrast, when LOINC updates from revision "1.0j" to "1.0k", this would be considered as just another version of LOINC, since LOINC revisions are backwards compatible.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="valueSet" type="Uid" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The value set that applied when this CD was created.

Value sets shall be referred to by an identifier name which allows unambiguous reference to a value set. Where either ISO or HL7 have assigned an identifying name to a value set, then that name shall be used. 

In many cases, a CD is created from a value set - either a code/code system pair is chosen from a valueSet, or one is not chosen and the CD has the exceptional value of NullFlavor.OTH. If no code is chosen, it is generally inappropriate to reference the code system from which the code was chosen as the value set may not match the code system (may include a subset of the codeSystem, or additional terms from other code systems); instead, the value set should be provided. In addition, there are some known use cases where the value set that a user or system was offered when choosing a code affects the interpretation of the code. 

If a code is provided, the meaning of the code must come from the definition of the code in the code system. The meaning of the code SHALL NOT depend on the value set. Information Processing Entities claiming direct or indirect conformance SHALL NOT be required to interpret the code in light of the valueSet, and they SHALL NOT reject an instance because of the presence or absence of any or a particular value set. </xs:documentation>

valueSetVersion SHALL be provided when a valueSet is provided, and otherwise SHALL be null. The value of the valueSetVersion must properly identify a particular version of the value set following the rules defined by the value set or its publisher. 

It is generally recommended that value set publishers specify that the version is identified by the date/time that the value set version is published, and that the publication process makes the date/time explicitly clearclear.  </xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="displayName" type="ST" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>A name, title, or representation for the code or expression as it exists in the code system.

If populated, the displayName SHALL be a valid human readable representation of the concept as defined by the code system at the time of data entry. The displayName SHALL conform to any rules defined by the codingSystem; if the codeSystem does not define a human representation for the code or expression, then none can be provided. displayName is included both as a courtesy to an unaided human interpreter of a code value and as a documentation of the name used to display the concept to the user. The display name has no functional meaning; it SHALL never exist without a code; and it SHALL never modify the meaning of the code. A display name may not be present if the code is an expression for which no display name has been assigned or can be derived. Information Processing Entities claiming direct or indirect conformance MAY choose not to implement displayName but SHALL NOT reject instances because displayName is present.

Display names SHALL not alter the meaning of the code value. Therefore, display names SHOULD NOT be presented to the user on a receiving application system without ascertaining that the display name adequately represents the concept referred to by the code value. Communication SHALL NOT simply rely on the display name. The display name's main purpose is to support implementation debugging.</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="originalText" type="ED" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>The text as seen and/or selected by the user who entered the data which represents the intended meaning of the user. 

Note: Local implementations may influence what is required to represent that original text.

Original text can be used in a structured user interface to capture what the user saw as a representation of the code on the data input screen, or in a situation where the user dictates or directly enters text, it is the text entered or uttered by the user. 

It is valid to use the CD datatype to store only the text that the user entered or uttered. In this situation, original text will exist without a code. In a situation where the code is assigned sometime after the text was entered, originalText is the text or phrase used as the basis for assigning the code. 

The details of the link in the originalText.reference between different artifacts of medical information (e.g., document and coded result) is outside the scope of this specification and may be further proscribed in specifications that use this specification.

The original text SHALL be an excerpt of the relevant information in the original sources, rather than a pointer or exact reproduction. Thus the original text SHALL be represented in plain text form. In specific circumstances, when clearly descirbed the context of use, the originalText may be a reference to some other text artefact for which the resolution scope is clearly described.

Values of type CD MAY have a original text despite not having a code. Any CD value with no code signifies a coding exception. In this case, originalText is a name or description of the concept that was not coded. Such CD values MAY also contain translations. 

Translations directly encode the concept described in originalText. The originalText represents the originalText of the concept itself. Translations SHALL NOT have an originalText of their own.</xs:documentation>

							<xs:documentation>A reference to the CD that was the source of this translation, if this CD was created by translating it from another CD. 

This property is a reference. The source to which the reference points SHALL be provided within the scope of this CD's root CD and translations; that is, another representation of the same concept in the same attribute.

A CD consists of a single root code and a set of translations, which do not have translations. Using the codingRationale property, a sender can indicate which is the original code. There are some circumstances in which it is useful to know which CD was translation from which CD. The source allows for the translation sequence from one translation to another to be represented. Each element of the translation set was translated from the original CD. Each translation may, however, also have further translations. Thus, when a code is translated multiple times the information about which code served as the input to which translation will be preserved</xs:documentation>

					<xs:element name="translation" type="xs:string" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1">
						<xs:annotation>
							<xs:documentation>A set of other CDs that each represent a translation of this CD into equivalent codes within the same code system or into corresponding concepts from other code systems.

The translations are quasi-synonyms of one real-world concept. Every translation in the set is supposed to express the same meaning "in other words." However, exact synonymy rarely exists between two structurally different coding systems. For this reason, not all of the translations will be equally exact. 
Translations SHALL NOT contain translations. The root CD has one set of translations which lists all the translations. The root translation is generally the one that best meets the conformance criteria for the CD. No implication about lineage of the translations can be drawn from the selection of the root code. Instead the properties codingRationale and source is used to trace lineage. 
In the absence of a constraining model that makes constraints on the value domain of the CD, any of the translations MAY be the root CD. If the constraining model makes constraints on the value domain of the CD and there is a translation that meets the constraints, that translation SHOULD be the root CD. If the constraining model makes constraints on the value domain of the CD and there is no translation that meets the constraints, then any of the translations MAY be the root, as long as they are assigned a nullFlavor. An alternative is to put none of the translations in the root, and give it a nullFlavor of choice, and put all the translations in the translation property of the root. </xs:documentation>
